An AI based chatbot system for the customer care service of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company(BAGIC) to reduce the current customer contact footprint from 40.3% to below 5% and move the same to chat, voice and video bots.
<br><br>
Users can interact with the chat system in 3 ways: Chat, Voice (Voice Bot) and Video (DeepFake).
<br/><br/>
The user can ask their query in the form of text or audio. The processed answer will be returned in one of the 3 ways mentioned above depending on the userâ€™s choice.
<br/><br/>
The answers will be searched using a search engine developed using ElasticSearch from data scraped from the BAGIC website to search for the answer.
</br><br/>
The output will be given in either a video format which is synthetically created using deepfake models (to make it look like a real person is speaking), audio format using text to speech technology or a simple textual reply.
